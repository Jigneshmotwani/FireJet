Question 2: Error in try {} catch {} block

    try {
    figma.showUI('<div>Hello</div>');
    } catch {}

Running the above function during codegen mode causes the FireJet Figma Plugin to crash with the error `figma_app.min.js.br:5 Error: in showUI: Cannot show UI`

1. The code crashes because the showUI() command is not allowed in codegen mode. However, suggest why it is still crashing despite being in the `try` block.
    Solution: 
    The reason the code crashes despite being in the `try` block, is that the 'catch' block has not been properly defined. In JavaScript, if a try block is used to catch errors, the catch block needs to explicitly specify an exception handler.
