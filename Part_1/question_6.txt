## Question 6: `fs is undefined`

When using build tools like vite or tailwind, sometimes we encounter the error `fs is undefined`

1. Name some cases where fs is defined and some cases where it is undefined
    Solution:
    - Cases where fs is defined: Sever side JavaScript, During build processes
    - Cases where fs is undefined: Client side JavaScript, server side rendering

2. In the case that fs is undefined, suggest how we can make fs defined, so that we can continue using build tools like vite and tailwind
    Solution:
    - Ensure that any usage of fs is confined to the server-side or build-time scripts. For example, read configuration files or assets during build time, not runtime.
    - If you need file interactions that require fs, consider creating an API that handles these operations on the server. The client-side can interact with these APIs to perform needed file operations securely.
    - For storage needs in the browser, consider using localStorage for small amounts of data or IndexedDB for larger, structured storage.
