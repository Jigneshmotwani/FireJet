## Question 5: Image not Updating

When converting a design with the [FireJet Figma Plugin](https://www.firejet.io/plugin), sometimes when the image is updated in our database, when visiting the website, the image still remains unupdated when viewing on codesandbox

1. Suggest why the image has not been updated
    Solution:
    The most common issue with the image not being updated is due to brower caching. If a CDN is used to serve images, the CDN may cache an older version of the image and serve it instead on the updated one. 

2. Suggest how we could get the image to be updated when viewed in codesandbox
    Solution:
    1. Adjust the CDN settings to have a shorter cache time, or manually invalidate cached files when an update occurs.
    2. Append a unique query string to the image URL every time it updates. This makes the URL unique, prompting the browser to fetch the new resource.
