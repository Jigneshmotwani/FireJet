## Question 3: Cannot call API

Trying to call the APIs at [https://api.github.com](https://api.github.com/) from the [FireJet Tweak](https://www.firejet.io/tweak) frontend throws an error.

1. Suggest the type of error and their reason
    Solution:
    The error messages that I see is this:
        WebSocket connection to 'wss://ws.hotjar.com/api/v2/client/ws?v=7&site_id=2878298' failed: The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Socket is not connected
        Websocket close was unclean: 1006
    This indicates a problem with establishing a websocket connection. Some reasons for such an error are:
    - The server at 'ws.hotjar.com' may be down or temporily unavailable preventing the websocket connection to be established.
    - The url or certain parameters like side_id may be incorrect.


2. Suggest a way to overcome the error, with some javascript snippets to support your answer
    Solution:
    - Double-check the WebSocket URL and any parameters you are using to ensure they are correct and expected by the server.
    - Check if there are any status updates or known issues reported for Hotjar services that might affect WebSocket connections.
    - Implement error handling in the websocket connection code. For example:

        function setupWebSocket() {
            const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ws.hotjar.com/api/v2/client/ws?v=7&site_id=2878298');

            socket.onopen = function() {
                console.log('WebSocket Connection established');
            };

            socket.onerror = function(error) {
                console.error('WebSocket Error:', error);
            };

            socket.onclose = function(event) {
                console.log('WebSocket closed. Attempting to reconnect...');
                if (!event.wasClean) {
                // Implement reconnection logic or notify user
                setTimeout(setupWebSocket, 5000); // Try to reconnect every 5 seconds
                }
            };
            }

            setupWebSocket();
